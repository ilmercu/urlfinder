# urlfinder

urlfinder is an enumeration tool which allows to find recursively all the URLs starting from a base one taken as input

URLs are taken from:
+ `href attribute` from `<a>` tags
+ `action attribute` from `<form>` tags

urlfinder retrieves:
+ URL endpoints
+ email addresses

Once an URL is found, query parameters (if any) are substituted with keywords `FUZZ0`, `FUZZ1`, etc. This allows to easily replace them injecting payloads using a fuzzing tool

urlfinder produces four files:
+ `url-complete-list.txt`: stores the list of all the original URLs found
+ `fuzzable-urls.txt`: stores the list of URLs containing `FUZZX` keywords
+ `mails.txt`: stores the list of email addresses
+ `phones.txt`: stores the list of phone numbers

The tool can retrieve only URLs coming from the same domain of URL passed as argument or retrieve the entire set of URLs based on domains in scope

**WARNING**: based on the target or on the list of scope domains, the execution of the tool could be endless (for example scanning a social media)
