# urlfinder

urlfinder is an enumeration tool which allows to find recursively all the URLs starting from a base one. URLs are taken from:
+ href attribute from `<a>` tags
+ action attribute from `<form>` tags

The tool can retrieve only URLs coming from the same domain of the base URL or retrieve the entire set of URLs based on domains in scope

python -m venv env
```

```
